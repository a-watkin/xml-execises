# XSLT transforms XML

## Notes to myself


### General notes

Written using XML

Can transform XML into almost anything

Can perform operations on XML

Chrome won't parse XLST in a static page, use either firefox or a webserver.

### Template XML file and XLST file

A template XML document is used to pass values into the XLST docuement

xpath selectors are used with select, to select the values from the template XML file

### So writing XSL is pretty much the worst thing ever

Really complicated syntax to do simple things, so easy to miss closing tags.
